Maybe you've seen the small badge at on this blog : I'm officialy a **Xamarin Certified Developer**!

I followed all the required courses of the Xamarin University for about two weeks and passed the exam with a score of 92%.

I really enjoyed each class, the University team did a great job at creating a solid learning program.
