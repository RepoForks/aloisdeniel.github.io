Welcome to my personal developer blogâ€”I'm really happy you found it! I'll try to share a maximum of concrete material about what I love to do : *coding*, *designing*, *drawing*, *travelling* and *everything else* I could come across.

For your information, I'm currently a professional mobile developer working for **Orange Business Services** in France and the frameworks I use the most today are [Xamarin](https://www.xamarin.com/), [Universal Windows Platform](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/dn894631.aspx), [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/), [Love2D](https://love2d.org/), [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/ios/), [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org/).

Bye~
