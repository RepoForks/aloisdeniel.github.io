# Me

 I'm a french Xamarin & Windows technical leader at Orange Business Services in Rennes, France. The tools I use everyday are the Microsoft ones (Visual Studio, TFS, .NET, Xamarin, UWP), but I love discovering other areas on my spare time : design (Photoshop, Sketch), video game development (LÃ–VE, MonoGame, SDL), web backend development (Node.js, Azure), web frontend development (HTML5, CSS3, Javascript).
